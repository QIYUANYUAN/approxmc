GCC bug
----------
Beware, GCC has a bug affecting propagation in UniGen:

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47365

This seems to affect all gcc versions 4.5.x and is latent in
trunk of upcoming 4.6.0

-----------
Libraries needed
-----------
You will need the following libraries to compile the sources:
* libz

-----------------
Building the source
-----------------

```
autoreconf -vfi
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make -j4
```

This should produce binary "approxmc" in the build directory.  ProbMapFile_36.txt and ProbMapFile_40.txt should be present in the directory from which approxmc is being invoked.



-----------------
Specifying Independent Support or Sampling Set
-----------------

To specify Independent Support or sampling set, you can specify the set in your CNF file by using "c ind" prefix. For example if the sampling set is {10, 13, 15, 16, 25, 28, 39, 41, 43, 45, 5, 53, 6, 69, 78, 9, 93}

c ind 10 13 15 16 25 28 39 41 43 45 0
c ind 5 53 6 69 78 9 93 0

Note that each "c ind" line can list only 10 variables at most, followed by a closing '0'.


----------------
Running ApproxMC
----------------
$ ./approxmc --epsilon=0.8 --delta=0.02 <input file>

Both epsilon and delta should be floats between 0 and 1.
Epsilon represents the accuracy of the result with respect to the
exact answer. (1-delta) is the confidence.

ProbMapFile_36.txt and ProbMapFile_40.txt should be present in the directory from which approxmc is being invoked.


--------------
Verbose debug
-------------
You can also turn on verbose debugging.
Simply remove the comment before 

"//#define VERBOSE_DEBUG" 
in Solver/constants.h and re-compile

When executing:

'./approxmc satfile.cnf'
You will see a LOT of debug info. You should therefore maybe do:

'./approxmc satfile.cnf > debuginfo.txt'
then you can open the 'debuginfo.txt' file from a text editor and have a look
